Almighty and eternal God,
Who created us in Your image and made us to seek after all that is good,
true and beautiful,
especially in the divine person of your only-begotten Son,
our Lord Jesus Christ,
grant we beseech Thee that,
through the intercession of Saint Isidore of Seville,
bishop and doctor,
during our journeys through the internet,
we will direct our hands and eyes only to that which is pleasing to Thee
and treat with charity and patience all those souls whom we encounter.
Through Christ our Lord.
Amen.

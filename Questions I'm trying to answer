1.  I've written two basic java programs in netbeans entitled Lion-and-Lamb, and JackFrostNipping.  How do I commit to branches 
  via git bash?  
  
2.  I created two text files with touch command.  One entitled, "diamond.txt" the other, "seasons.txt".  If they appear along with 
  many numerous other files within that branch after issuing the ls command, how do I only push the single file to the desired 
  branch?

3.  I downloaded PyCharm.  It asks for an interpeter, what does this mean?  Again, as the same with the java programs, how do I 
  commit the programs to GitHub repo via git bash?
  
Tips:
1.  Jack, you're pushing up braanches with files, not individual files.  The changes with respect to the already existing files
are commited to the branch.

2. mkdir.  pwd.(tells you which directory you are in).  rmdir.(removes directories if empty).

3. git diff. git diff --cached.  (VIM -adventures.com)

4. rm. removes a file in a branch that hasn't been committed.

5. cp --------------------------------------------------------------- path --------------------------------------  . (dot means in current directoryy)
  ~(tilda) home directory of current user

6. Its best to use linux for python. (interpreter) (M. Gallagher).

7.  I created a branch called "olive", immediately - all the files of the other branches were populated into the branch.  I did not intend for this to 
    happen.  Tip: A branch is a "snapshot" of your working directory.  It will eventually be merged back into master once you
    are satisfied with the changes.  Its not used for just storing files.
